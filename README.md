I'm a simple dev.

🔭 I’m currently working on IT

🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and more technology.

🌐 Frontend Developer (React & Maps Enthusiast)
Building interactive, data-rich web apps with a love for geospatial tech and performance hacks!

🗺 Geo-Spatial & Data Visualization:

Crafted interactive maps with React + Mapbox GL JS, rendering real-time GeoJSON layers (farm boundaries, plots, and more).

Supercharged visuals with Deck.gl (WebGL):

✨ Custom icons & dynamic tooltips for location-based actions.

🌱 Hexagon heatmaps for data density (because dots are so last decade).

⚡ Performance Ninja:

Processed 10K+ geo-datasets offline using Web Workers (bye-bye UI freezes!).

Optimized tile loading with dynamic bounding strategies (lazy maps = happy users).

Memoized all the things (React.memo, useMemo) to keep complex layers smooth.

🌍 Real-Time Magic:

Integrated WebSockets for live device tracking (sensors, vehicles, you name it).

Added 3D terrain layers (elevation, slopes—because flat maps are boring).

🤝 Team Player Moves:

Collaborated on UX prototypes (polygon selections, dynamic filters).

Championed clean geo-library practices (RIP memory leaks, hello event listener cleanup).

Tech Stack:
React · TypeScript · Mapbox GL JS · Deck.gl · WebGL · WebSockets · GeoJSON · Web Workers

Turning complex data into delightful interfaces—one pixel at a time! 🚀
